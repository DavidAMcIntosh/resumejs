This is a small project made using ChalkJS and InquirerJS. 

Inquirer is used to display prompts to the user.

Chalk is used to offer colorful console logs, instead of the boring defaults. 

This project is simply my resume, offered as an npm package and node cli app. 

It was made to provide me with an introductory lesson in publishing my own npm packages, and also creating cli apps (if I ever need to).
